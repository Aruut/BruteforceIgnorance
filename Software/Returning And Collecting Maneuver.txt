Returning And Collecting
========================



The 'return to collect' maneuver is triggered when the collection mechanism has been turning for at least X seconds since the robot last fired and the lifter QRD is NOT triggered.

Return to Collect Maneuver
--------------------------
	(Collection motor is always on)
	- Continue strafing (with wall following algorithm) in the same direction.  Target IR can be ignored, but collection mechanism should still be turning and the lifter QRD should be monitored.
	- If the lifter QRD is triggered (accidental collection, etc.), cancel the return maneuver and go back to the strafe-fire maneuver.
	- Strafe until a side touch sensor is triggered.
	- Strafe in opposite direction for X seconds (until approx. between the side-most and center tape lines).
	- Begin ignoring the lifter QRD input.  Continue turning collection mechanism, but while line-following do not stop the maneuver if the lifter QRD is triggered.

	- Convert to differential steering (turn servos to differential angles).
	- Turn about 135 degrees (motors driven in opposite directions, for X seconds).  The robot should be pointing at an angle towards the center line of tape.
		- If it was strafing left-to-right, turn 135 degrees clockwise.
		- If it was strafing right-to-left, turn 135 degrees counter-clockwise.
	- Drive forwards until either of the center tape sensors detect the tape.
	- Follow the tape using the center tape sensors (PD algorithm) until either of the front touch sensors are triggered.  Begin 'collecting' maneuver.



The 'collecting' maneuver is triggered once the 'return to collect' maneuver reaches the collection wall at the end of the tape line.

Collecting Maneuver
-------------------
	(Collection motor is always on)
	- Slowly (50% speed) turn towards the triggered touch sensor until the other front touch sensor triggers as well.
	- Wait X seconds.
	- Back up straight a short ways (X seconds while motors are reversed).
	- Angle the robot slightly (about 5 degrees).
	- Drive forwards until both front touch sensors are triggered again.
	- Check if loading arm QRD has been triggered.
    	- If it has, loading is done: run the 'return to wall' maneuver.
    	- If it has not been triggered, repeatedly back up and ram the wall at alternating angles until the loading QRD is triggered.
