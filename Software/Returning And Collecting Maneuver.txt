Returning And Collecting
========================

The 'returning and collecting' maneuver is triggered when the collection mechanism has been turning for at least X seconds since the robot last fired and the lifter QRD is NOT triggered.

Note: the collection mechanism is run throughout all of this maneuver.

Maneuver:
---------
	- Continue strafing (with wall following algorithm) in the same direction.  Target IR can be ignored, but collection mechanism should still be turning and the lifter QRD should be monitored.
	- If the lifter QRD is triggered (accidental collection, etc.), cancel the return maneuver and go back to the strafe-fire maneuver.
	- Strafe until a side touch sensor is triggered.
	- Strafe in opposite direction for X seconds (until approx. between the side-most and center tape lines).

	- Begin ignoring the lifter QRD input.  Continue turning collection mechanism but while line-following do not stop the maneuver if the lifter QRD is triggered.

	- Convert to differential steering (turn servos to differential angles).
	- Turn about 135 degrees (motors driven in opposite directions, for X seconds).  The robot should be pointing at an angle towards the center line of tape.
		- If it was strafing left-to-right, turn 135 degrees clockwise.
		- If it was strafing right-to-left, turn 135 degrees counter-clockwise.
	- Drive forwards until either of the center tape sensors detect the tape.

	- Follow the tape using the center tape sensors (PD algorithm) until either of the front touch sensors are triggered.
	- Slowly (50% speed) turn towards the triggered touch sensor until the other front touch sensor triggers as well.
	- Wait X seconds.
	- Back up straight a short ways (X seconds while motors are reversed).
	- Angle the robot slightly (about 5 degrees).
	- Drive forwards until both front touch sensors are triggered again.
	- Check if loading arm QRD has been triggered.
    	- If it has, loading is done: run the 'return to wall' maneuver.
    	- If it has not been triggered, continue to briefly back up and then ram the wall at alternating angles until the loading QRD is triggered.
