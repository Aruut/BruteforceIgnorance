NOTES
=====

EMPTY STATE:
	Checked every loop:
		Empty if the lifting arm is empty AND a certain delay has passed since last firing
	Checked every target found:
		Empty if lifting arm is empty

	If the robot hits a wall while in the empty state, it begins the return to collection maneuver.


STATE MACHINE:
	Now keeps track of the current state (or 'looping maneuver').  Discrete maneuvers (like firing) are not kept track of, instead they are called by other looping maneuvers.

	Menu is entered through Update(), when the stop button is pressed.
	Menu is exited through Update(), when the start button is pressed.  Switches to the last state of the machine.

STEERING SERVO ANGLES
	Need to figure out what angle to use for servo steering (bike vs. perp).  Are the angles inverted between the two servos?

MOTOR DIRECTIONS IN DIFF. STEERING
	Motors need to spin in opposite directions to go straight when in differential mode.  Which way is correct for forward motion?

BOOLS
	Many of the bools may have their logic backwards.  Need to check after flashing it to the TINAH or just think a little harder.

ADDED INTEGRAL GAIN
	Had to change existing code so that servos would be turned in opposite directions.  Check this.

DELAYS
	#define LOAD_DELAY 250
	#define REBOUND_DELAY 2000
	#define EMPTY_DELAY 5000
	#define WALL_FOLLOW_END_DELAY 3000
	#define SERVO_TRANSFORM_DELAY 250
	#define MOVE_OFF_WALL_DELAY 500
	#define TURN_135_DEG_DELAY 500
	#define COLLECTION_DELAY 1000
	#define COLLECTION_REVERSE_DELAY 250

LASERS DEPRECIATED
	Commented out the laser wall-following code.
		This includes the EEPROM addresses, pin definitions, direction definitions, global variable declarations, Menu items, WallFollowUpdate, WallFollow

HELPFUL FUNCTIONS
	Added the helper functions QRD(int qrdPin), CollectionQRD(), and IR(in irPin).  They function similairly to Microswitch(int pin) but without any debounce.

CAN'T EXIT TO MENU FROM DISCRETE MANEUVERS
	Need to add Update to all loops in discrete maneuvers.

LINE FOLLOWING BUG
	Line following was incorrectly using the compensation speed, fixed it so that the compensation speed is applied to each wheel in opposite directions.

NO MORE SECRET MENU
	Added secret (state) menu to regular menu.  Secret firing level is now state 5, accessed through the state menu

ADDED DIFFERENT VELOCITIES
	For line following up and down the slope.

MICROSWITCH LOGIC
	The front microswitches now have reversed logic in Microswitch().
