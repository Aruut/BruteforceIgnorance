NOTES
=====

EMPTY STATE:
	Checked every loop:
		Empty if the lifting arm is empty AND a certain delay has passed since last firing
	Checked every target found:
		Empty if lifting arm is empty

	If the robot hits a wall while in the empty state, it begins the return to collection maneuver.


STATE MACHINE:
	Now keeps track of the current state (or 'looping maneuver').  Discrete maneuvers (like firing) are not kept track of, instead they are called by other looping maneuvers.

	Menu is entered through Update(), when the stop button is pressed.
	Menu is exited through Update(), when the start button is pressed.  Switches to the last state of the machine.

STEERING SERVO ANGLES
	Need to figure out what angle to use for servo steering (bike vs. perp).  Are the angles inverted between the two servos?
