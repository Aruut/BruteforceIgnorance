  Firing System
=================

The firing system uses two rollers, spinning in opposite directions.  The rollers use a similair design to the ball-collector brush: strings strung between two plates with holes along their circumferences.  The rollers driven by a single motor and are geared together, ensuring both spin at the same rate.  The ball is lifted from a ramp below the firing mechanism into place between the rollers by a servo-actuated arm.
