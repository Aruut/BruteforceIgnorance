Design aspects to explain:
	- Differential rear wheel drive for tape-following
	- Wheel size
	- Need for this particular rotating-wheel design
	- Lazy-Susan bearings
	- Servo actuated, absolute positioning
		- >90deg range of rotation, with minimal moment and shear passed onto the servo
		- General rigidity

The design of the robot's drive system addresses its need to steer while moving forwards and strafe laterally along the target wall.

Differential Rear Wheel Drive
-----------------------------

While the robot is following tape and tracking an IR beacon, it is advantageous for it to use rear differential drive to turn and steer.  With reflectance sensors for the tape placed towards the front of the robot, the distance between the center-of-steering and the tape-sensors is maximized; this leads to faster and more accurate tape-following.

However, with the center of steering placed towards the rear of the robot the moment of inertia around this point will become trickier to minimize.  Placing the relatively heavy firing mechanism and battery along the center axis of the robot will help to minimize the moment of inertia.


Straffing
---------

In order to quickly traverse along the row of targets, the robot will strafe along the top wall of the arena, stopping to fire and re-collect when an un-flipped target is detected.  In order to strafe, the rear wheels are both rotated 90degrees until they are parallel to the wall.  The angle and speed of the wheels can be adjusted based on the wall-detecting sensors so that the robot maintains an accurate course.

With the rotating wheel design,
